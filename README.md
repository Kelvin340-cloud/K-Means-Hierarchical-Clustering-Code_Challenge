# K-Means-Hierarchical-Clustering-Code_Challenge
Hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are both popular unsupervised machine learning techniques used for clustering analysis. Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters either from the bottom-up (agglomerative) or top-down (divisive) approach. It does not require the number of clusters to be specified beforehand, providing a dendrogram to visualize the clustering structure and enabling flexibility in cluster identification post-analysis. On the other hand, K-means clustering partitions data into K clusters based on minimizing the sum of squared distances within each cluster. It requires specifying the number of clusters (K) a priori and assigns each data point to the cluster with the nearest centroid iteratively until convergence. K-means is computationally efficient but may not perform well with non-spherical clusters or varying cluster sizes compared to hierarchical clustering. Each method has distinct advantages depending on the dataset characteristics and desired outcomes of clustering analysis.
